abstarct method-abstract class;
abstract class- abstract method;
if we have abstract method in a class then definitely the class is abstract, recursive is not true
we can maintain an abstract class without any abstract method 


Abstract class cannot be instantiated

child class object can be created if child class is non abstract class
