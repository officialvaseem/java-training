# String-Immutable,stringbuffer,stringbuilder
when string objects need  to be modified very often we should not use string objects

## stringBuffer-java.lang-Mutable class-synchronized class
we cannot make the string literal as mutable by using the stringBuffer
'StringBuffer sb="abc;"

#synchronized-Method is same,it is thread safe , when a object of a file is running we cant alter
it is a native method
string buffer is thread safe
all the methods are synchronized 

#string buffer example:-
mobile--->speaker
playsong()--speaker
IncomingCall()--speaker
-sequential action

# StringBuilder-non synchronized class -java.lang-mutable class-JDK 1.5;
A mutable sequence of characters.This class provides an API compatible with
 StringBuffer,but with ' no guarentee of synchronization
 string builder is thread safe
 all methods are not synchronized methods 

#Method(string buffer)
append()
insert(offset,"char seq")
reverse()
deleteCharAt(index)
replace(start,end,"char seq")
hashCode()
